# Lip cancer

Here is the lip cancer data given to you in terribly unreproducible and error-prone format. 

- `aff.i` is proportion of male population working outside in each region
- `observe.i` is observed deaths in each region
- `expect.i` is expected deaths, based on region-specific age distribution and national-level age-specific mortality rates. 

```{r}

## Question 1

Explain a bit more what the `expect.i` variable is. For example, if a particular area has an expected deaths of 6, what does this mean?

* Answer: The expected death is the death number calculated by the age distribution of the target example times the mortality rate of the whole population. If a particular area has an expected deaths of 6, which means if there are no special circumstances, this area should have an appoxiamatly 6 deaths among all the people.

## Question 2

Run three different models in Stan with three different set-up's for estimating $\theta_i$, that is the relative risk of lip cancer in each region:

1. $\theta_i$ is same in each region $= \theta$
2. $\theta_i$ is different in each region and modeled separately
3. $\theta_i$ is different in each region and modeled hierarchically
```{r}
x <- aff.i - mean(aff.i)
offset <- expect.i
deaths <- observe.i
N <- length(x)

data <- list(x = x,
             offset = offset,
             deaths = deaths,
             N = N)

fit1 <- stan(file = "./case1.stan", data = data)
summary(fit1)$summary[c("theta"),]
```


```{r}
x <- aff.i - mean(aff.i)
offset <- expect.i
deaths <- observe.i
N <- length(x)

data <- list(x = x,
             offset = offset,
             deaths = deaths,
             N = N)

fit2 <- stan(file = "./case2.stan", data = data)
summary(fit2)$summary[c(1:5),]
```


```{r}
x <- aff.i - mean(aff.i)
offset <- log(expect.i)
deaths <- observe.i
N <- length(x)

data <- list(x = x,
             offset = offset,
             deaths = deaths,
             N = N)

fit3 <- stan(file = "./case3.stan", data = data)
param <- extract(fit3)
summary(fit3)$summary[c(1:5),]
```


## Question 3

Make three plots (appropriately labeled and described) that illustrate the differences in estimated $\theta_i$'s across regions and the differences in $\theta$s across models.

* Answer:
For the first graph. We plot the sample distribution of 195 different independent theta for the second models. The y axis are the distribution of theta and the x axis are the relative risks.

For the Second graph. We plot the sample distribution of the third models. The x axis and the y axis are the same definition as above. For plot 1&2 we could see the differences between region and their relative risks.

```{r, echo = F}
alpha = summary(fit2)$summary[-196, c(4,8)]
alpha_df = as.data.frame(alpha)
colnames(alpha_df) <- c("min", "max")
alpha_df$x = observe.i/expect.i

colnames(alpha_df) <- c("theta", "theta", "relative_risk")
alpha_new = rbind(alpha_df[,c(1,3)], alpha_df[,c(2,3)])

ggplot(data = alpha_new, aes(x = relative_risk, y = theta)) + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "blue", se=FALSE) + stat_summary(
  size = 0.2,
  fun.min = min,
  fun.max = max,
  fun = mean)
```

```{r, echo = F}
alpha = exp(t(extract(fit3)$theta))
alpha_df = as.data.frame(matrix(ncol=0, nrow = 195))
alpha_df$min = apply(alpha, 1, FUN=quantile, probs = c(0.025))
alpha_df$max = apply(alpha, 1, FUN=quantile, probs = c(0.975))
alpha_df$relative_risk = observe.i/expect.i

colnames(alpha_df) <- c("theta", "theta", "relative_risk")
alpha_new = rbind(alpha_df[,c(1,3)], alpha_df[,c(2,3)])

ggplot(data = alpha_new, aes(x = relative_risk, y = theta)) + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "blue", se=FALSE) + stat_summary(
  size = 0.2,
  fun.min = min,
  fun.max = max,
  fun = mean)
```

* On the third plot we could plot the estimation of theta from three models on the same graph. The black line indicate the estimation of theta from model 1(no pooling, same value for all theta). We could see the hierarchical model (model 3, half pooling) has a better estimation(more concentrated) than separate model (model 2, complete pooling) .

```{r, echo = F}
theta = data.frame(matrix(nrow = 195, ncol = 0))
theta$model2 = summary(fit2)$summary[-196, 1]
theta$model3 = apply(alpha, 1, FUN=mean)
theta$index = seq(1, 195, 1)
theta <- melt(theta, id.vars = 'index', variable.name = 'group')

ggplot(data = theta, aes(x = index, y = value)) + geom_point(aes(colour = group)) + geom_abline(intercept = 0.9550164, slope = 0)
```
